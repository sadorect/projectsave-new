## Current Task: ASOM Dashboard Revamp & LMS Integration

### 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Revamping the ASOM (Archippus School of Ministry) student dashboard to be more professional, user-friendly, mobile-responsive and interactive. Integrating it seamlessly with the existing LMS system while maintaining brand consistency.

### ✅ COMPLETED WORK

#### Phase 1: Enhanced ASOM Dashboard Design (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created modern ASOM dashboard layout with course progress overview
- ✅ Implemented interactive navigation tabs (Overview, Courses, WhatsApp Groups, Achievements)
- ✅ Added achievement/milestone tracking display with dynamic unlocking
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded data with dynamic database queries
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design with proper breakpoints

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Lesson Views & Integration (COMPLETED) 
- ✅ Professional lesson show page with gradient headers and breadcrumbs
- ✅ Beautiful lesson index page with course statistics and progress tracking
- ✅ Enhanced completion modal with confetti effects and progress updates
- ✅ Mobile-responsive lesson navigation with completion indicators
- ✅ ASOM progress summary added to main user dashboard

#### Phase A: ASOM Dashboard Course Logic Fix (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Fixed course filtering bug (was showing ALL courses instead of just ASOM courses)
- ✅ Implemented dual tabs: "My Courses" vs "All Courses" with proper counts
- ✅ Separated data collections for enrolled vs available courses
- ✅ Enhanced course cards with enrollment status, dates, and progress

### 🚧 PENDING WORK

#### Phase B: Create Unified Layout System (TODO - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Lesson views don't match ASOM dashboard design - using old `x-layouts.lms` component
**Files affected**:
- `/resources/views/lms/lessons/index.blade.php` (line 1: `<x-layouts.lms>`)
- `/resources/views/lms/lessons/show.blade.php` (line 1: `<x-layouts.lms>`)
- `/resources/views/lms/courses/show.blade.php` (needs redesign)

**Tasks**:
1. Extract navigation component from ASOM dashboard
2. Create shared header with user profile and menu
3. Replace LMS layouts with consistent design system
4. Apply ASOM dashboard styling to lesson views

#### Phase C: Debug Lesson Completion Communication (TODO - CRITICAL)
**Problem**: "Failure to mark lesson as complete" error message, but lesson actually gets marked complete on refresh
**Location**: Communication error between frontend JavaScript and backend controller
**Files to check**:
- `/app/Http/Controllers/LMS/LessonProgressController.php` (response format)
- `/resources/js/lms-progress.js` (error handling)
- Route: `lessons.complete` (check if route uses correct parameters)

**Debugging steps**:
1. Check if route expects `[$course->slug, $lesson->slug]` vs `[$course->id, $lesson->id]`
2. Verify LessonProgressController returns proper JSON response
3. Check JavaScript error handling in completion form

#### Phase D: Redesign Course Detail View (TODO - MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Course detail view still uses old LMS layout
**File**: `/resources/views/lms/courses/show.blade.php`
**Tasks**:
1. Remove `x-layouts.lms` dependency
2. Apply ASOM dashboard styling and layout
3. Create consistent course detail template

### 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

#### Key Files Modified
1. **ASOM Controller**: `/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredAsomUserController.php`
   - Enhanced `welcome()` method with proper course filtering
   - Added dual course collections: `$enrolledCoursesWithProgress` and `$availableCoursesWithProgress`
   - Fixed enrollment checking logic

2. **ASOM Dashboard View**: `/resources/views/asom-welcome.blade.php`
   - Implemented tabbed interface with Overview, Courses, Groups, Achievements
   - Added dual course tabs with JavaScript toggle functionality
   - Mobile-responsive design with animations

3. **User Dashboard**: `/resources/views/user/dashboard.blade.php`
   - Added ASOM progress summary with real-time calculations
   - Enhanced navigation with dual action buttons

4. **Lesson Views**: 
   - `/resources/views/lms/lessons/show.blade.php` - Enhanced with modern styling
   - `/resources/views/lms/lessons/index.blade.php` - Added course statistics and progress
   - `/resources/views/lms/lessons/_completion_modal.blade.php` - Improved modal design

5. **JavaScript**: `/resources/js/lms-progress.js`
   - Enhanced completion handling with loading states and error handling
   - Real-time progress updates and confetti effects

#### Database Integration
- **Course filtering**: Fixed to only include ASOM courses by title
- **Progress tracking**: Uses existing `LessonProgress` model and `course_user` pivot table
- **Achievement system**: Connected to real completion data

#### Route Structure
- ASOM routes: `/routes/auth.php` (asom.welcome, asom.join)
- LMS routes: `/routes/lms.php` (lessons.complete, lms.lessons.index, lms.lessons.show)

### 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **CRITICAL**: Lesson completion shows error but actually works (Phase C)
2. **Layout inconsistency**: Lesson views use old LMS layout (Phase B)
3. **Course detail page**: Needs redesign to match ASOM dashboard (Phase D)

### 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM

#### Color Palette
- Primary gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
- Success gradient: `linear-gradient(135deg, #28a745 0%, #20c997 100%)`
- Card shadows: `0 5px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`
- Border radius: `15px` for cards, `25px` for buttons

#### Component Patterns
- **Cards**: White background, rounded corners, subtle shadows
- **Buttons**: Gradient backgrounds, hover animations, icon integration
- **Progress bars**: Striped and animated for active states
- **Navigation**: Tab-based with smooth transitions

### 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate (Phase C)**: Fix lesson completion error communication
2. **High Priority (Phase B)**: Create unified layout system for LMS views
3. **Medium Priority (Phase D)**: Redesign course detail view
