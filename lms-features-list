- lessons (id, course_id, title, video_url, duration, order)
- assignments (id, lesson_id, title, instructions, due_date)
- quizzes (id, lesson_id, title, passing_score)
- quiz_questions (id, quiz_id, question, options, correct_answer)
- enrollments (id, user_id, course_id, progress, completed_at)
- certificates (id, user_id, course_id, issued_at)
- announcements (id, course_id, title, content, published_at)
